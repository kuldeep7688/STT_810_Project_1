## In this project we are going to explore and work on the below:

### Preferential Attachment Model
- The preferential attachment model concerns a growing network, where the probability of a
new node attaching to an old node is proportional to the number of connections that old node
has. There is code on D2L to create a simulation of the network up to 15 nodes. The
connections.
