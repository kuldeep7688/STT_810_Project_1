# Statistics 810 Project 1
- This is the mid-semester Statistics 810 project. IT involves working on data exploration and simulation using R. 

## In this project we worked on the below tasks:
### Preferential Attachment Model
- The preferential attachment model concerns a growing network, where the probability of a
new node attaching to an old node is proportional to the number of connections that old node
has.
- We wrote the simulation code for variable intitialization parameters.
- We also analysed the simulations to discover some interesting patterns.   
### NNDB Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis


## Languages Used
- R was used for both data exploration as well as for the simulation of the Preferential Attachment Model and its analysis.
